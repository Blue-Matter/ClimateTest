Description: Forecasting climate impacts on exploited marine populations is
    highly uncertain. Forecasting models have struggled to pass typical 
    requirements of peer-review. This has been an impediment to the adoption of
    fishery management procedures that are demonstrably climate robust. 
    Climate Test rephrases the evaluation of management procedures, focusing on
    management procedure performance given increasingly extreme climate scenarios
    rather than performance for a scientifically defensible projection. This is 
    analogous to testing pilots in a simulator of extreme weather conditions. 
    It is possible to simulation test pilots to find the pilot that is best able
    to fly in challenging weather conditions without a precise weather forecast. 
    Similarly, the Climate Test ramps up climate impacts to rate candidate 
    management procedures according to their ability to navigate increasingly 
    challenging climate impacts.
